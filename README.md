# Probablity-And-Statistics-Assignment

To run this preogram, install the python libraries : Numpy and Matplotlib according to ur system
To run the program : python3 PDFsOfDifferentTimespans.py
Make sure you are in the same directory.

Task:
Observe the time gaps between your next 30 WhatsApp messages. (You may replace WhatsApp with any instant messaging app of your choice, or email messages if you prefer)
You may choose to measure the time gaps in minutes or seconds, depending upon whichever you find most interesting. 

I have written a program in Python to accomplish the following tasks:
1. Load all the observations from our experiment into an appropriate data structure. We may hard-code your data or read it from a file depending upon your choice.
2. For the purpose of the remaining task let us call these samples x1, ... , x30.
3. For each i=1 to 30, find the sample mean and sample variance of the first i samples.
(For example when i=10, you would find the sample mean and sample variance of x1,...,x10).

Plot a relative frequency line graph of your data (if you prefer using the frequencies instead of relative frequencies, that is also fine).
Plot a graph of the exponential and normal pdfs using the sample mean and variance you have computed (of all 30 observations), as parameters. 
Decide which one matches better.

Ans : Normal PDF matches better
